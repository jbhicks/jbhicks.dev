# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This document provides guidelines and instructions for using GitHub Copilot effectively in this project.

## General Guidelines

1. **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the project. This includes indentation, naming conventions, and comment styles.
2. **Documentation**: Ensure that all new functions and significant code blocks are well-documented with comments explaining their purpose and usage.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for all new code. Log errors where appropriate and provide meaningful error messages.
4. **Testing**: Write tests for new features and ensure that existing tests pass before committing changes.

## Specific Instructions

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ syntax (e.g., `let`, `const`, arrow functions).
- Prefer `async/await` over Promises for asynchronous code.
- Use template literals for string concatenation.

### Go

- Follow idiomatic Go practices as outlined in [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
- Use `gofmt` to format Go code before committing.
- Ensure that all exported functions and types have comments.

### HTML/CSS

- Use semantic HTML5 elements where possible.
- Follow the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for CSS class naming.
- Ensure that CSS is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

### Markdown

- Use proper Markdown syntax for headings, lists, links, and code blocks.
- Ensure that all Markdown files are well-structured and easy to read.
