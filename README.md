My home on the web. Goals include:  

1. An About page that reads like an informal resume
2. A Dashboard that contains feeds of common things I like to keep up to date on:
   1. Music
      1. Soundcloud Stream
      2. Soundcloud Favorites
   2. News
      1. RSS news feed from my curated list of sources
      2. Latest from my X.com feed
      3. Stock tracker
   3. Projects
      1. Links to any side projects I happen to do
   4. A contact page where a simple listing of all my social media / email address appear
