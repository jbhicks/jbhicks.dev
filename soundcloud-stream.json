Earthdance holds a very special place in our hearts. For a decade, I put my heart and soul into producing an Earthdance festival in Florida every September from 2009-2018. We were all very happy to have our Earthdance Florida family showcased on one of the days during this week long event.\n\nMy set premiered right after the Global Synchronized Prayer for Peace on September 21, 2024. So I was very happy to put this set together that was focused all around love, inner peace, empowerment and acceptance.\n\nYou can check out all of my friend's DJ Sets for this event at the playlist link here:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFOoJE8e1bbDWobR-Et1_WREMP4ElRTH5\u0026si=LqsgtQoZXNbAjpFy \n\n✨Enjoy the Journey✨\n\n⭐ Subscribe to my channel to hear the latest Juicy Mix Journeys! xoxo \n\nMuch LOVE to all the producers whose tracks I feature in this Juicy Mix! 💗\n\nTracklist: \n\n1.

He worked for the German powerhouse ZYX Music \u0026 NYC's Waako Records as A\u0026R/promotions director and label manager.\n\n\u2028Doug desire to express his love through production for what he affectionately calls \"That New York sound\", a mix of organic, soulful music, combined with afro latin rhythms, is evident on all his productions. It led to an onslaught of releases and remixes on such notable labels including Universal Music, Orianna/Sony Music, MoBlack, Nervous Records, Quantize recordings, King Street Sounds, Z Records, and many more.\n\nDoug has remixed such great artists as Kerri Chandler, Dennis Ferrer, Blaze, and many more.\n\u20282017 saw the start of his own label Merecumbe Recordings, as an outlet not just for his own music, but from current hot and upcoming producers","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3600562,"full_duration":3600588,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"AFRO HOUSE","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1916106050,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2024-09-13T16:28:23Z","license":"all-rights-reserved","title":"AFRICA VOICES by SPYMBOYS"}},{"created_at":"2024-10-05T18:48:06Z","type":"track-repost","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-yzxueTOGLjz1ceR2-WSyKLA-large.jpg","first_name":"Remco","followers_count":519,"full_name":"Remco Brokken","id":118940344,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2024-09-29T10:08:53Z","last_name":"Brokken","permalink":"remco-brokken","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/remco-brokken","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/118940344","urn":"soundcloud:users:118940344","username":"REMCO BROKKEN","verified":false,"city":"Venlo","country_code":"NL","badges":{"pro":false,"creator_mid_tier":false,"pro_unlimited":true,"verified":false},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:118940344","station_permalink":"artist-stations:118940344"},"uuid":"160","caption":null,"reposted":{"target_urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1929500447","user_urn":"soundcloud:users:118940344","caption":null},"track":{"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-y9GcQzdY4idwUeep-6cNqmg-large.jpg","caption":null,"commentable":true,"comment_count":29,"created_at":"2024-10-05T18:15:41Z","description":"","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":1785310,"full_duration":1785339,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Dance \u0026 House","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1929500447,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2024-10-06T17:20:28Z","license":"all-rights-reserved","title":"Mini Party Warm Up Mix Vol.2 (Surprise Mix)"}},{"created_at":"2024-10-05T18:47:50Z","type":"track-repost","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-yzxueTOGLjz1ceR2-WSyKLA-large.jpg","first_name":"Remco","followers_count":519,"full_name":"Remco Brokken","id":118940344,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2024-09-29T10:08:53Z","last_name":"Brokken","permalink":"remco-brokken","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/remco-brokken","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/118940344","urn":"soundcloud:users:118940344","username":"REMCO BROKKEN","verified":false,"city":"Venlo","country_code":"NL","badges":{"pro":false,"creator_mid_tier":false,"pro_unlimited":true,"verified":false},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:118940344","station_permalink":"artist-stations:118940344"},"uuid":"161","caption":null,"reposted":{"target_urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1927063301","user_urn":"soundcloud:users:118940344","caption":null},"track":{"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-UDc7e2YxBBp3FNz8-VXOVHg-large.jpg","caption":null,"commentable":true,"comment_count":45,"created_at":"2024-10-01T16:12:05Z","description":"","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":4584982,"full_duration":4585012,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"House","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1927063301,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2024-10-01T18:52:28Z","license":"all-rights-reserved","title":"Made quickly on Monday"}},{"created_at":"2024-10-05T18:43:30Z","type":"track-repost","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-Bx34GCLkI7zRAXUP-wliS0w-large.jpg","first_name":"Thug","followers_count":1876,"full_name":"Thug Shells","id":127988221,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2024-09-26T03:55:13Z","last_name":"Shells","permalink":"thugshells","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/thugshells","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/127988221","urn":"soundcloud:users:127988221","username":"Thug Shells","verified":false,"city":"Bay Area","country_code":"US","badges":{"pro":false,"creator_mid_tier":false,"pro_unlimited":true,"verified":false},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:127988221","station_permalink":"artist-stations:127988221"},"uuid":"164","caption":null,"reposted":{"target_urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1908245987","user_urn":"soundcloud:users:127988221","caption":null},"track":{"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-YyBDaOOMycsn2YA8-OvXV8A-large.jpg","caption":null,"commentable":true,"comment_count":0,"created_at":"2024-09-01T19:19:26Z","description":"Feel good spicy summa Drum \u0026 Bass vibes \n\nI present to you my first DnB mix I played at our annual friends summer gathering this summer.

Launching into the scene with their first singles in 2020, they struck gold with their hit collaboration with Lane 8, ‘Run,’ which has been streamed over 40M times, and they haven’t looked back since.  \n\nThe duo's journey has been explosive over the years since their first ‘Human Learning EP’ in 2020. Most widely known for their enthralling live performances, the duo has played some of the world's most well-known venues and festivals, like Printworks, Coachella, Red Rocks, and The Gorge, alongside shows across four continents. Their songs have also been heard worldwide on the radio, including features on BBC Radio 1 and SiriusXM, the latter bringing in a #1 hit on BPM with ‘Run.’\n\nIn 2023, the duo sold out their first-ever headline tour focusing on legendary rock venues around North America.  Towards the end of the year, their final shows were cut short after revealing that frontman \"Mickey\" had been diagnosed with cancer. Following a short hiatus from touring and music at the start of this year, the release of their next collaboration with Lane 8, 'Remission' marked the official return of Kasablanca after the pair debuted the track during their LIVE sets at Ultra Music Festivals in Miami, Chile, and Peru.\n\nFollowing ‘Remission,’ Kasablanca has been on a blistering pace over this past summer with three more lead-up singles and a run of over 20 tour dates this year, with another 20 still to come before the end of the year.  Singles ‘Terminal Feeling’ and ‘Daydream’ with anamē gave fans differing sonic styles from the melodic techno duo, with their viral anthem ‘Breathe’ finally landing in August.  The official cover of the 1996 hit by The Prodigy started with a viral video in 2023, and 10M views later has seen support worldwide from streaming platforms and radio stations alike.\n\nWith the Side A release of their debut album, ‘Higher Resolution, ’ Kasablanca now takes their next step on their meteoric rise. Led by the title track of the same name, the album brings fans on an epic journey from to finish.  Four new original mixes take center stage on the body of work, with ‘Clarity’ being a familiar anthem to fans who have seen Kasablanca live over the past six months as it tore up dance floors from Bonnaroo to Fabric and with multiple videos of the track on social media garnering millions of views.  \n\nSide A of Kasablanca’s ‘Higher Resolution’ album is out now on Anjunabeats.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. init\n2.
