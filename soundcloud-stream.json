He worked for the German powerhouse ZYX Music \u0026 NYC's Waako Records as A\u0026R/promotions director and label manager.\n\n\u2028Doug desire to express his love through production for what he affectionately calls \"That New York sound\", a mix of organic, soulful music, combined with afro latin rhythms, is evident on all his productions. It led to an onslaught of releases and remixes on such notable labels including Universal Music, Orianna/Sony Music, MoBlack, Nervous Records, Quantize recordings, King Street Sounds, Z Records, and many more.\n\nDoug has remixed such great artists as Kerri Chandler, Dennis Ferrer, Blaze, and many more.\n\u20282017 saw the start of his own label Merecumbe Recordings, as an outlet not just for his own music, but from current hot and upcoming producers","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3600562,"full_duration":3600588,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"AFRO HOUSE","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1916106050,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2024-09-13T16:28:23Z","license":"all-rights-reserved","title":"AFRICA VOICES by SPYMBOYS"}},{"created_at":"2024-10-05T18:48:06Z","type":"track-repost","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-yzxueTOGLjz1ceR2-WSyKLA-large.jpg","first_name":"Remco","followers_count":518,"full_name":"Remco Brokken","id":118940344,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2024-09-29T10:08:53Z","last_name":"Brokken","permalink":"remco-brokken","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/remco-brokken","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/118940344","urn":"soundcloud:users:118940344","username":"REMCO BROKKEN","verified":false,"city":"Venlo","country_code":"NL","badges":{"pro":false,"creator_mid_tier":false,"pro_unlimited":true,"verified":false},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:118940344","station_permalink":"artist-stations:118940344"},"uuid":"325","caption":null,"reposted":{"target_urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1929500447","user_urn":"soundcloud:users:118940344","caption":null},"track":{"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-y9GcQzdY4idwUeep-6cNqmg-large.jpg","caption":null,"commentable":true,"comment_count":33,"created_at":"2024-10-05T18:15:41Z","description":"","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":1785310,"full_duration":1785339,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Dance \u0026 House","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1929500447,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2024-10-06T17:20:28Z","license":"all-rights-reserved","title":"Mini Party Warm Up Mix Vol.2 (Surprise Mix)"}},{"created_at":"2024-10-05T18:47:50Z","type":"track-repost","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-yzxueTOGLjz1ceR2-WSyKLA-large.jpg","first_name":"Remco","followers_count":518,"full_name":"Remco Brokken","id":118940344,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2024-09-29T10:08:53Z","last_name":"Brokken","permalink":"remco-brokken","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/remco-brokken","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/118940344","urn":"soundcloud:users:118940344","username":"REMCO BROKKEN","verified":false,"city":"Venlo","country_code":"NL","badges":{"pro":false,"creator_mid_tier":false,"pro_unlimited":true,"verified":false},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:118940344","station_permalink":"artist-stations:118940344"},"uuid":"326","caption":null,"reposted":{"target_urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1927063301","user_urn":"soundcloud:users:118940344","caption":null},"track":{"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-UDc7e2YxBBp3FNz8-VXOVHg-large.jpg","caption":null,"commentable":true,"comment_count":46,"created_at":"2024-10-01T16:12:05Z","description":"","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":4584982,"full_duration":4585012,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"House","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1927063301,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2024-10-01T18:52:28Z","license":"all-rights-reserved","title":"Made quickly on Monday"}},{"created_at":"2024-10-05T18:43:30Z","type":"track-repost","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-Bx34GCLkI7zRAXUP-wliS0w-large.jpg","first_name":"Thug","followers_count":1877,"full_name":"Thug Shells","id":127988221,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2024-09-26T03:55:13Z","last_name":"Shells","permalink":"thugshells","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/thugshells","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/127988221","urn":"soundcloud:users:127988221","username":"Thug Shells","verified":false,"city":"Bay Area","country_code":"US","badges":{"pro":false,"creator_mid_tier":false,"pro_unlimited":true,"verified":false},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:127988221","station_permalink":"artist-stations:127988221"},"uuid":"329","caption":null,"reposted":{"target_urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1908245987","user_urn":"soundcloud:users:127988221","caption":null},"track":{"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-YyBDaOOMycsn2YA8-OvXV8A-large.jpg","caption":null,"commentable":true,"comment_count":0,"created_at":"2024-09-01T19:19:26Z","description":"Feel good spicy summa Drum \u0026 Bass vibes \n\nI present to you my first DnB mix I played at our annual friends summer gathering this summer.
